            A block is the smallest unit of a block chain.<br/><br/>
            For our example it consists of only 5 elements:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Block number:</strong> The Number of the block in the chain. Integer that
                    starts at 1 and is increased by one for every new block.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Nonce:</strong> A number that is used to make a block valid. Its sole purpose
                    is to be adjusted until the hash of the whole block has certain properties that make it "valid".
                </li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> The actual data of the block. Can be anything!</li>
                <li><strong>Previous block hash:</strong> The hash of the previous block. For the first block in a chain an arbitrary value like
                    00000000000... is used (something that is very unlikely to be a real hash).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hash:</strong> All previous elements appended together and then hashed. For our example the hash is calculated with the
                    following code:
                    <pre>CryptoJS.SHA256([blockNumber, nonce, data, prev].join(''))</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
            A block is considered "valid" if its hash has a certain form. For our example we want the hash to start with a certain amount of zeroes.<br/>
            The higher the number of zeroes we want a hash to start with, the harder it will be to find a nonce that makes the hash of the block to look
            the way we want. This is what is called the difficulty. You can change the difficulty of this example page by enabling expert mode.
